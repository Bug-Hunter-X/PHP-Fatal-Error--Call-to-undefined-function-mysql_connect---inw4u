This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP code: the use of deprecated `mysql_*` functions.  The `bug.php` file contains code that uses these outdated functions, resulting in a fatal error in PHP 7.0 and later. The `bugSolution.php` file shows how to correct this using the MySQLi extension or PDO. This is a crucial issue to address for maintaining compatibility and security in PHP applications.
